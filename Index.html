            My name is SOSPETER STEPHEN. 
            I hold Diploma in Biomedical Engineering from Kenya Medical Training College. 
            I currently work as the Head of Biomedical Engineering at Lions SightFirst Eye Hospital. The leading Eye Hospital in East And Central Africa. 
            We pride ourself as the best because of the facility and the equipment we have in the Hospital. 
            They the modern technology you can ever imagine. 
            <P>
                The journey of becoming the best version of one's self is to work on the small habit that hinder our daily progress. We must stay focused on the goal we intend to achieve instead of hovering on different objectives.
